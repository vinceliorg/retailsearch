Tasty, portable snack.
This is a tasty snack. So portable - great for kids and adults alike. Really good cheesy flavour. It's a snack that's not too heavy - but really hits the spot when you need a savoury hit.
✔ Yes, I recommend this product.

Handy snack
These are a great afternoon snack - great for work or to keep in your bag when you're out and about and don't have access to a fridge.
The cheese is really tasty and the crackers are nice and crisp. I just wish the packs came in bigger sizes!
✔ Yes, I recommend this product.

Unexpected enjoyment.
As we are a pair of Oldies 70s and 80s, we had thought that Le Snak was a product only aimed at Children, surprisingly, it is very enjoyable and it will be included in our future shopping cart!
✔ Yes, I recommend this product.

Easy Tasty Snacks
The Le Snak Tasty Cheese 'dip and crackers' come in an easy open and store box. The crackers have a good flavour and crunch, and pair perfectly with the yummy tasty cheese spread. There's enough for each cracker in each small pack. Great snacks and very tasty!
✔ Yes, I recommend this product.

Great crackers but there's not enough of them!
I was so excited to have a Le Snak as an adult after growing up having them in my lunchbox frequently as a child, however I was a bit underwhelmed. I loved the taste and texture of the crackers but found there weren't enough of them in the pack (only 3) and the cheese smelt and tasted very artificial. If I were to make any adjustments, I would increase the number of crackers and improve the taste and flavour of the cheese.
✘ No, I do not recommend this product.

Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts. It’s great to hear you’ve enjoyed the crackers although we’re sorry that you haven’t loved the dip. Uncle Tobys Tasty Cheese Le Snak is made with real tasty cheese and doesn't contain any artificial colours or flavours. We also appreciate your feedback that you’d like to see more crackers in this snack!

Great to grab & go!
These are great to put in lunch boxes or to keep handy in your bag for a quick, healthy snack. The cheese is lovely and creamy and has good flavour to it and the biscuits are light and crisp and even taste good on their own.
✔ Yes, I recommend this product.

Great taste!
Great for a quick savoury snack. Convenient, can take it with me anywhere, easy to store. Easy to eat. Crackers are crispy without being hard or dry. Cheese dip has a delicious flavour. Great combination.
✔ Yes, I recommend this product.

Great small snack to get through the afternoon
This was a surprisingly tasty product that did a great job at beating 3:30itis. It is enough of a flavour hit to keep you happy but doesn't ruin the afternoon by snakcing excessively. I will likely track this down again and enjoy on more hungry afternoons!

Details
Features:
Pink Lady’s are a popular apple variety that is known for its brilliant pink blush colour that covers its vivid green-yellow skin. Contrary to popular belief, the pink blush is not an indicator of sweetness as different varieties of Pink Lady apples have differing amounts of colouring, it is in fact the yellow undercoat under the blush that indicates it’s sweetness!The crunchy white flesh of these apples creates an almost ‘fizz’ like burst of flavour with each bite. Their sweet and slightly tarty flavour makes them a perfect lunchbox healthy snack for the kids!Apples are a great source of Vitamin C along with calcium, iron, boron and pectin with most of the nutrients directly under the skin, this is why is it healthier to eat your apples with their skin on.

Details
Features:
Pink Lady’s are a popular apple variety that is known for its brilliant pink blush colour that covers its vivid green-yellow skin. Contrary to popular belief, the pink blush is not an indicator of sweetness as different varieties of Pink Lady apples have differing amounts of colouring, it is in fact the yellow undercoat under the blush that indicates it’s sweetness!The crunchy white flesh of these apples creates an almost ‘fizz’ like burst of flavour with each bite. Their sweet and slightly tarty flavour makes them a perfect lunchbox healthy snack for the kids!Apples are a great source of Vitamin C along with calcium, iron, boron and pectin with most of the nutrients directly under the skin, this is why is it healthier to eat your apples with their skin on.

Details
Storage Instructions:
Store in a cool, dry place.
Usage Instructions:
Use this product to cover and protect blisters.
Hydro Seal Gel Plasters provide the Optimal Healing Environment (Compared to traditional plasters).
1. Clean the blister. Wash the affected area and dry thoroughly.
2. Skip the ointment. To ensure the plaster properly adheres, do not apply creams, ointments or lotions to the blister.
3. Seal it up. Carefully remove the white paper tabs and apply the gel plaster directly on the blister. There is no pad.
4. Watch it work. Within 24 hours of application the product will begin to swell and a white bubble will appear over the blister. This signals that your body's natural healing process has begun.
5. Keep it on - no peeking! This plaster is designed to deliver multi-day protection. You can wear it until it begins to detach.
Size:
4 Pack
Warning:
Sterile unless individual wrapper is opened or damaged.
Warnings : Diabetics and those with poor circulation should use under the supervision of a Health Care Professional.
Contraindications: Do not use on deep puncture wounds, fragile skin, burns, stitches, infected areas, or on children under 2 years of age. If redness, swelling, or allergic reactions occur or if blister condition persists, discontinue use and consult your doctor.
